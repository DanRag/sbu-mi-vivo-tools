AB Interval Monte Carlo offers an alternative to second-order approaches
   for modeling measurement uncertainty in a simulation framework. Using
   the example of computing quasi-extinction decline risk for an ecological
   population, an interval Monte Carlo model is built. If the model is not
   written optimally, the mean and standard deviation of the growth rate
   repeat, then the bounds on the quasi-extinction risk will be
   sub-optimal. Depending on your operational definition of what an
   interval is, the sub-optimal bounds may be the best possible bounds. A
   comparison between second-order and interval Monte Carlo is made, which
   reveals that second-order approaches can underestimate the upper bound
   on the quasi-extinction decline risk to the population when there are a
   large number of parameters that need to be sampled.
